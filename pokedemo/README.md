# Lab: 09 - Web requests

- This file contains boilerplate of how to receive data from an API Application programming interface

- (URL/URI) Uniform Resource Locator / Identifier
- (SSL) Secure Sockets Layer - people make security layer in either SSL or TLS
- (TLS) Transport Layer Security
- IOException

## Tips

- Follow the steps in the boilerplate code
- Refer to this video: [GSON/JSON Part 2 With Web Data](https://zoom.us/rec/play/8PJbHSqbV5GxvOJlmzH8W5eAxiCNxiPK_BaahSqQscVP2sFUc4fe63AMTUKRpQOYnofkYErSnf9m8Ak.lktJaPyQM9g7yviv?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=IxIE9yXkSwC0_DchrG2jsg.1648482768481.4ced4012d8344f3ca94bb1d6c2942c69&_x_zm_rhtaid=378)

- Be sure to add the [GSON dependency ](https://github.com/google/gson) to your `build.gradle` file and refresh gradle
- Utilize [Swagger](https://inspector.swagger.io/builder)
- Build classes to extract the items you want in the JSON file
  - When building classes.. naming conventions directly correlate to the properties of the JSON object.
  - You cannot choose to change the names of these variable.

## Reflection

- Reviewing the material was great
- Need to remember that no worries not fully understanding some things, just be able to do what you need to do
- Boilerplate is boilerplate.
