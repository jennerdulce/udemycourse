## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Time: O(n)
  - The time for my algorithm depends on how big the array is.
  - At worst case scenario will take O(n)

- Space: O(1) (-->ADDITIONAL SPACE <--)
  - My algorithm completes the challenge inline, utilizing the same array that was passed in.
  - We are not creating a new array.
